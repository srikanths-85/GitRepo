create a git repository with the name "GitRepo" using command prompt and sync up with the github.
The Team A and Team B were working on the same project. Team A going to commit the work done by them with the name "commit no 1". 
Team A forgot to add a few changes in previous commit so commit few changes and Modifying the commit message with "First Commit Modified". Make a note of commit ID. 
Clone the same repo in another location which is going to use by Team B. Modify the git username and email for that repository alone and add a gitignore file with certain 
extension/specific file name and commit it with the commit ID(got from the previous commit of Team A). In the team A cloned repo, revert the last commit (i.e., git ignore commit made by Team B and commit it to remote).
Now the Team B create the pre-commit hook which validate the commit message either length/regex. Then create the New Branch with the name "GitBranch" by using the command prompt and sync it. 
Team B works on the same branch and commit it. pust to remote and create PR and merge it. Finally share the github URL, CLI logs.
